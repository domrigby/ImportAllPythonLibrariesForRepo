# ImportAllPythonLibrariesForRepo
This repo will create a Linux command which will import all the Python libraries inside a GitHub repository or just a directory.
Currently it will only go one directory deep into the directory. I was trying to code it on bash which I haven't used much before, but will write a proper version on Python.

To use:

$ sudo chmod +x setup \n
$ sudo ./setup
